# 'xcode' module

This repository is designed to be used as a submodule to the [`set-me-up` blueprint](https://github.com/dotbrains/set-me-up-blueprint) repository.

⚠️ **Note**: This repository should not be used as a standalone script because it has a dependency on an existing 'set-me-up' configuration already installed on your machine.

## _Why abstract these modules to an external repository?_

Please see the [universal modules documentation](https://github.com/dotbrains/set-me-up-universal-modules#why-abstract-these-modules-to-an-external-repository) for more details on this point.
